## The India TB Pathways dataset is based on a study conducted in Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, India. It examines the pre-diagnostic costs and health-seeking behavior of 880 new adult pulmonary tuberculosis patients registered at Primary Health Centres (PHCs).

```{python}
tb_data=pd.read_csv(".venv\data\india_tb_pathways_and_costs.csv")
tb_data
```


```{python}
![Map of Tamil Nadu. Vellore district is in the north-east.]("images\tndistrict_1.png")
```


```{python}
tb_data=pd.read_csv(".venv\data\india_tb_pathways_and_costs.csv")
tb_data
```

```{python}
px.histogram(tb_data, color="Sex", x="Form of TB", title="Distribution of  form of TBs among different genders")
```
## Tuberculosis positives were mostly male ini smear +

```{python}
max_age = int (tb_data.Age.max())
common_edu = tb_data.Education.mode()[0]
```

```{python}
px.box(tb_data, x="Age", y="Education", color="Sex", title="Distribution of ages in Different Educational Status")
```

In Tuberculosis cases, maximum age was **'{python}max_age'.**
In Tuberculosis cases, common education status was **'{python}common_edu'.**


```{python}
tips = px.data.tips()
max_tip=int(tips.tip.max()) # int needed to print clearly
common_day=tips.day.mode()[0]
```

In Tuberculosis cases, maximum age was **'{python}max_age'.**
In Tuberculosis cases, common education status was **'{python}common_edu'.**


```{python}
px.histogram(tb_data, x="Age", y="Education", color="Sex", title="Distribution of Ages in Different Educational Status")
```
