## Explanation: Tuberculosis positives were mostly male ini smear + 

```{python}
max_age = int(df_tb.Age.max())
common_edu = df_tb.Education.mode()[0]
```

```{python}
px.box(df_tb, x="Age", y="Education", color="Sex", title="Distribution of ages in different educational status")
```
In Tuberculosis cases, maximum age was **'{python} max_age'.**
In Tuberculosis cases, common education status was **'{python} common_edu'**


```{python}
tips = px.data.tips()
max_tip = int(tips.tip.max()) # int needed to print clearly
common_day = tips.day.mode()[0]
```

In Tuberculosis cases maximum age was '{python} max_age'.
In Tuberculosis cases common education status was '{python} common_edu'

```{python}
